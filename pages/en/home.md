Vespa-Watch is the Flemish hotline for nests of Asian hornets.

Your reports are useful for the monitoring and research of the species in Flanders. Reports of individual hornets are useful to locate nests.

[Report a nest](/en/report-nest/){:.btn .btn-primary} or report an individual via [waarnemingen.be](https://waarnemingen.be/go/vespa-velutina/) or [inaturalist.org](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/upload).

## Why are Asian hornets harmful?

The Asian hornet (_Vespa velutina_) is a wasp species from Southeast China. Since 2016, the species also occurs in Belgium. It is an 'invasive alien species':

- The species did not originally occur here, but is now rapidly increasing in number and spreading throughout Flanders.
- It attacks honey bees and other native insects that pollinate our flowers and plants.
