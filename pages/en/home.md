The first Asian hornet appeared in Belgium in 2016. Since then the species has expanded rapidly. This wasp comes from China. It targets bees and other insects and is considered an invasive alien species. In Belgium, it is monitored. The population is managed by exterminating nests. 

Surveillance requires many eyes on the lookout, including yours! Find out here how you can help detect an Asian hornet in the citizen science project Vespa-Watch. Your data will then be used for control and research.

For all questions on control and initiating control actions contact hoornaar[at]vbi.vlaanderen.
