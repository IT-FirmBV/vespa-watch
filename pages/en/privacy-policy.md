Thank you for your interest in the Vespa-Watch project and for your help in gathering information about Asian hornets. On this page we explain how we handle your (personal) data collected via this website.

## Who manages the Vespa-Watch website?

The Vespa-Watch website is managed by the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be).

## What happens with my data?

Through the Vespa-Watch website we collect reports of nests (and previously individuals) of Asian hornets. A report consists of general data (location, time, photo, etc.) and personal data (name, e-mail, etc.).

These data are permanently stored on a secure server. We remove reports with inappropriate photos (including copyrighted photos taken from the web) and incorrect locations that cannot be verified.

To protect the environment, for scientific purposes and in line with the [open data policy of the INBO](https://www.inbo.be/en/open-data-policy), all _general data_ associated with reports are made available under a [Creative Commons Zero waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). After validation, these data are also published on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org), a global aggregator for biodiversity data. This way, Vespa-Watch data can be used worldwide for policy, management and research. Data can also be displayed on other websites, such as [waarnemingen.be](https://waarnemingen.be/) and [observation.org](https://observation.org/).

## What happens with my personal data?

The Vespa-Watch website does not require registration to make a report. We do ask for your contact details (name, telephone, e-mail) when reporting a nest. We will only use these personal data to contact you for additional information in regards to your report or to eradicate a nest. Your personal data are only accessible to people involved in the Vespa-Watch project, such as researchers or people who detect and remove nests. Your personal data will not be used for other purposes, will not be shared with third parties outside the project and will not be displayed on the website.
