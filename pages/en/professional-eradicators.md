We are a hotline for monitoring the species but do not coordinate control ourselves at the moment. **Control of Asian hornet nests is currently not reimbursed by the government.** We always provide those reporting an Asian hornet nest with a list of certified professional eradicators in Flanders, whom they can contact as they wish. Have you followed specialized training in 'Management of the Asian hornet' and are you a professional wasp exterminator? Send an e-mail to vespawatch@inbo.be to be added to the list of certified Asian hornet eradicators in Flanders. We provide this overview to reporters of an Asian hornet nest.

By registering as a professional wasp eradicator, here referred to as the enterprise, you and your enterprise engage in the effective neutralization and removal of Asian hornet (_Vespa velutina_) nests in compliance with the applicable code of conduct and legislation as well as taking the necessary safety precautions to do so. Vespa-Watch can in no circumstances be held responsible for incidents (damage to people, equipment or materials) or financial losses as a result of the intervention. Vespa-Watch does not intervene in the financial agreements between the enterprise and the nest owner. Vespa-Watch does not provide direct financial or material support to control operations.

Extra security measures should be taken when removing a nest of the Asian hornet. As such, [Inverde](https://www.inverde.be/opleidingen/verdelging-en-verwijdering-van-aziatische-hoornaars) and [VBI](https://vlaamsbijeninstituut.be/opleiding-voor-verdelgers-aziatische-hoornaar/) organize nest removal trainings specified for this species.
