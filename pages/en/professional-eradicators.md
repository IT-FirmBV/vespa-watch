By registering as a professional wasp eradicator, here referred to as the enterprise, you and your enterprise engage in the effective neutralization and removal of Asian hornet (_Vespa velutina_) nests in compliance with the applicable code of conduct and legislation as well as taking the necessary safety precautions to do so. Vespa-Watch can in no circumstances be held responsible for incidents (damage to people, equipment or materials) or financial losses as a result of the intervention. Vespa-Watch does not intervene in the financial agreements between the enterprise and the nest owner. Vespa-Watch does not provide direct financial or material support to control operations.

Extra security measures should be taken when removing a nest of the Asian hornet. As such, VBI organizes nest removal training specified for this species. Please, contact the VBI in case you are interested in participating to such a training.
