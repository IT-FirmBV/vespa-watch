## What happens with my report?

- We will validate your report. This can take a couple of days.
- **Contact your fire department in case of immediate danger**, for example when the nest is located near a house or other high-risk area.
- We will notify you if it concerns a nest of Asian hornets.
- We will also send you an overview of professional erradicators specialized in the species. You can contact these if you prefer, we currently don't assign an erradicator to your report automatically.
