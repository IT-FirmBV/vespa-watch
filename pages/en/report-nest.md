This form is under development in preparation for the next field season.

This time of the year, queens awaken from dormancy and begin to build an embryonic nest. This is a small nest with the size of a ping-pong ball, in a sheltered place.

Report a nest to <vespawatch@inbo.be> with the following information:

- Coordinates or address where the nest is located
- Time of observation
- Photo of the nest
- Your name and telephone number

We will validate your report en notify you if it concerns a nest of the Asian hornet.
