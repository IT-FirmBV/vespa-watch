This form is under development in preparation for the next field season.

Nests are currently dormant due to the cold weather. You may come across a queen that hibernates in a sheltered place outside the nest. A nest is never reused and can therefore remain.

Reporting a nest of Asian hornet remains useful to map the distribution of the species. However, no professional eradicator will be assigned at this time. For questions you can always contact <vespawatch@inbo.be>.

Report a nest to <vespawatch@inbo.be> with the following information:

- Coordinates or address where the nest is located
- Time of observation
- Photo of the nest
- Your name and telephone number
