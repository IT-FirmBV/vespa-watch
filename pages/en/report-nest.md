This time of the year, queens awaken from dormancy and begin to build an embryonic nest. This is a small nest the size of a ping-pong ball, in a sheltered place.

## What happens with my report

- We will validate your report. This can take a couple of days.
- **Contact your fire department in case of immediate danger**, for example when the nest is located near a house or other high-risk area.
- We will notify you if it concerns a nest of Asian hornets.
- We will also send you an overview of professional erradicators specialized in the species. You can contact these if you prefer, we currently don't assign an erradicator to your report automatically. A coordinated control for Asian hornet is in preparation.

## Report a nest

Report a nest to <vespawatch@inbo.be> with the following information:

- Coordinates or address where the nest is located
- Time of observation
- Photo of the nest
- Your name and telephone number
